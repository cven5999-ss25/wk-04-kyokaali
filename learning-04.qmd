# Learning reflections

Learning reflections are part of your weekly homework and have a weight of 20% of your final grade. Write a reflection in your own words on the different parts of the weeks material below. You can also use your learning reflections as a notebook as you work through exercises or readings. Write as much as you like, but a minimum of 100 words in total.

# Lecture

\<The lecture was very helpful, as always. It introduced many new
functions that expanded my understanding of how data can be organized, filtered, and transformed into meaningful subsets based on specific needs. It was insightful to see how flexible and powerful data manipulation in R can be. However, I recognize that consistent practice is essential to gain speed and familiarity with the different operations and workflows.\>

# Homework Assignment

\<The homework was equally engaging. Although it involved working with several new functions, it gave me a valuable opportunity to explore the full potential of R in manipulating and presenting data. I particularly enjoyed how the same dataset could be transformed in multiple ways and experimenting with different approaches to achieve similar results. I was also glad to finally resolve the issue I
had with committing to GitHub, which I discovered was due to not accepting the invitation to the repository, a simple oversight that had not occurred to me.\>

# Readings

\<The readings significantly deepened my understanding of how to manipulate and explore data in a structured and efficient way. I appreciated the clear explanations and practical examples that demonstrated how to transform datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. I also gained valuable insights into how combining different steps in a seamless workflow enhances both clarity and efficiency. Overall, the readings increased my confidence in working with real-world data and preparing it for further analysis and visualization.\>

# Submit learning reflections

## Stage, Commit & Push to GitHub

This final section introduces the workflow you need to follow at the end of each live coding exercise, homework assignment, learning reflection. It ensures that all the changes you have made to files in this repository (folder) are synced with the version that is stored on GitHub. The steps will be described at the end of each of the files.

1.  Open the Git pane in RStudio. It's in the top right corner in a separate tab.
2.  **Stage** your changes by checking appropriate box next to all files (if you select one file with your mouse, you can then highlight them all with Ctrl + A on your keyboard and check all boxes)
3.  Write a meaningful commit message (e.g. "Completed homework assignment 1b) in the **Commit message** box
4.  Click **Commit**. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.
5.  Go to your course-material GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files.

## Open an issue on GitHub

Once you have ensured that the Quarto document renders without errors and you have pushed all your changes to GitHub, it is to complete the assignment by opening an issue on your course-material GitHub repo.

1.  Navigate to your course-material GitHub repo.
2.  Click on **Issues**, and then **New issue** button.
3.  Write a meaningful title in the **Title** field
4.  Tag the course instructor with using the `@` sign in combination with `larnsce` as the username
5.  Add any questions or comments
